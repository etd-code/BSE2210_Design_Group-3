- **AI Tools Used:** Drafting structure of report, generating diagrams, brainstorming design trends  
- **Human Effort:** Critical thinking, refinement of business case, creation of final artifacts, recording group discussion  
- **Balance:** AI assisted in structuring and ideation, but all final choices, refinements, and discussions were **human-driven**
